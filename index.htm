			<h2 class="card-title">Activity, creativity, and design: Modeling and assessing student development in a project-based course</h2>
			<h3>Abstract</h3>
			<p>The development of creativity and design ability in a group of undergraduate students enrolled in a design course were explored in this study. A review of literature was used to develop a coding scheme that integrated the domains of creativity, design, and activity theory which was then applied to content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). This study used a mixed methods research design and an activity system analysis (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002). Participant surveys, design journals, and interviews were used to assess the students’ design thinking traits during the 15-week course duration. The overarching finding of this study was a description of how a community emerged among the students and instructor. This community acted as a collective design tool to help the students expand their design creativity. The data supporting this finding were as follows: (1) high levels of learner autonomy supported participants’ motivation; (2) the course community provided extended time and opportunities for practice; and (3) participants’ final reflections centered on experience within the community and newly felt creative agency (Karwowski & Beghetto, 2018; Royalty et al., 2014). How this occurred is discussed, a five-factor model of the course activity system is proposed, and an assessment instrument for similar courses is provided. Guidelines for the design and implementation of similar courses are proposed, and suggestions for continued research are offered.</p>

			<h3>Proposal</h3>

			<p>This study investigated how creative design ability developed for an interdisciplinary group of undergraduate students as they identified, designed, and delivered final projects to solve everyday problems. The research effort sought to better understand what contextual elements shaped students’ creative design ability and to find evidence of creativity and design thinking in students’ developmental process. Outputs of the study were (a) theoretical model for growing a community of creative designers and (b) guidelines for revision and implementation of similar course designs. The data suggested that the development of creative design ability is strongly influenced by prototyping within a supportive community and when students are given high degrees of autonomy in their coursework. High degrees of autonomy in project work appeared to support students’ intrinsic motivation, which appeared to support students as they navigated the uncertainty and contradictions associated with the creative design process. Activity theory, as an analytical framework for conducting research, emphasized the connections between learners, practical activity, and community.</p>

<p>Several methods were used to gather the data for this study, and an exploratory mixed-methods design (Creswell, 2009) was selected. The mixed-methods design afforded a blend of survey, design journal, and interview data within an analytical framework specified by activity theory (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002) and was informed by the theoretical perspective of social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978) and constructionism (Papert & Harel, 1991). Data was collected via (a) a longitudinal series of student design journals, (b) student interviews, and (c) a design thinking traits survey. Data analysis and interpretation were guided by the analytical framework of activity theory (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002), thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Mann, 2016), and descriptive statistics (Huck, 2008; Spatz, 2008). Findings were organized and reported using activity theory (Engeström, 2014).</p>
<p>This study found the major contextual factors surrounding students’ creative design process to be motivation, tool use, prototyping, community, and creative confidence. Additionally, the ambiguity of the design process was a mediating factor for most students. Given that the data emphasized the importance of community for shaping the development of students’ creative design ability, a model was developed to serve as a guide for the design and implementation of project-based courses when creative design ability is the desired outcome.</p>
<p>
	This study blended the creativity and design literature with the systems framework of activity theory to gain a firmer understanding of how creative design ability develops for novice designers in a higher education setting. 
	It appears that high levels of learner autonomy, project-work within a supportive community, and extended time for practice led to outcomes of creative agency and the use of the course community as a collective design tool. A cluster of five interrelated factors, their dimensions, and their changes throughout the course stood out as the main contextual factors that shaped participants’ creative design ability. These factors were (a) tool exploration, (b) prototyping, (c) community, (d) motivation, and (e) creative agency. The course’s community emerged as a collective hub for activity that was shaped and amplified by the other factors. Importantly, the course instructor modeled an overall tone of psychological safety (Baer & Frese, 2003; Edmondson et al., 2016; Newman et al., 2017; Rogers, 1954) supportive of creative expression and provided practical guidance for the use of creative design methods. Learner autonomy facilitated participants’ motivation and engagement with personally meaningful design choices. This dynamic and entangled cluster of factors were the most frequently mentioned actions and affect throughout the journal and interview data, which suggests them as factors that can accurately model the course as an activity system.
</p>
<p>A reason why these five factors received the highest amount of coded references is that they frequently overlapped with each other. In other words, the most referenced codes were also the most interconnected. It is difficult to talk about one factor without mentioning the others, and therefore they are discussed from a systems perspective.</p>
<p>A higher-level perspective across the course activity system reveals three general categories that organize the five factors that emerged from this study. The three categories were (a) actions (e.g., behavior, cognition), (b) affect (e.g., emotions), and (c) social (e.g., environmental.) Actions included cognitive behaviors that were not directly observable, such as problem finding and framing, along with more directly observable behaviors such as prototyping and tool exploration. Affect included participants’ feelings, such as motivation and creative agency. The social category included the courses’ community and its dimensions. Collapsing activity to fewer than these three categories would impair meaningful discussion of it.</p> 
<p>Attendees will be asked to use supplied handouts to describe environments familiar to them in terms of activity systems. This brief activity will be followed by a group discussion in which results from the group will be compared to better illuminate the adaptive power of activity theory as an analytical framework for a wide range of learning environments.</p> 
<p>These findings suggested the course was similar to what Engeström (2014) called a humanized activity system—a system in which participants enjoy high degrees of freedom in their work. The co-emergence of intrinsic motivation and creative agency with expanded tool ability suggested this course was similar to the formative interventions as discussed by (Sannino et al., 2016; Sannino, 2011), in which participant development results in participants learning to use a systems approach to take ownership of their learning and apply learned strategies to new, unforeseen, and ill-structured problems. Thus, this research points to a blueprint for a systems framework for expanding (and researching) the diversity of individuals’ interests and creative design ability as collective design hubs that can effect change across an eclectic and interdisciplinary group of learners and knowledge domains.</p>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>This paper reports on a larger study that investigated how creative design ability developed for an interdisciplinary group of undergraduate students as they identified, designed, and delivered final projects to solve everyday problems. The research sought to better understand what contextual elements shaped students’ creative design process and to find evidence of creativity and design thinking in students’ developmental process.</p>
			<p>Tool exploration and prototyping were the most frequently referenced actions and appeared to grow the course community which reciprocally served to expand prototyping and tool exploration. The community became gradually more pronounced as students took several weeks to choose personally meaningful individual projects and select the design and development tools for their project work. Mid-way in the course, a prototyping community became one of the most predominant contextual factors shaping student development. Data suggested this high degree of learner autonomy instantiated intrinsic motivation structures that supported persistence through challenging project work. The most frequently reported outcomes were increases in creative confidence and new design methodologies. Persistence through challenges was linked to increases in tolerance of ambiguity—the uncertainty inherent to creative design.</p>
			<p>Outputs of the study included (a) a theoretical model for growing a community of creative designers and (b) suggestions for future research. The data suggested that development of creative design ability was strongly influenced by community, where tool exploration and prototyping were the predominant actions carried out by students. The contradictions, or challenges students reported were often rooted in the interaction of tool use, prototyping, and community.</p> 
			<h3>Methodology</h3>
				<p>Several methods were used to gather the data for this study, and an exploratory mixed-methods design (Creswell, 2009) was selected. The mixed-methods design afforded a blend of survey, design journal, and interview data within an analytical framework specified by activity theory (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002) and was informed by the theoretical perspective of social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978) and constructionism (Papert & Harel, 1991.) A depiction of the course as an activity system is shown in Figure 1.</p>

				</figure>
				

				<p>Data was collected via (a) a longitudinal series of student design journals, (b) student interviews, and (c) a design thinking traits survey. The student design journals were a sequence of four entries during weeks three, seven, 13, and 15 and part of students’ normal course work. There was a total of 112 journal entries with an average count of 379 words per entry. The student interviews were conducted during the final weeks of the course. Time duration of the interviews ranged from 16 to 47 minutes with an average duration of 32 minutes. Interview word counts ranged from 3718 to 9246 with an average word count of 6150 words per interview. The survey was a pre-existing one developed by Blizzard et al. (2015) to measure design thinking traits and was comprised of nine item statements scored along a five-point Likert scale. The survey was administered as a pre/post instrument once during the second week of the course and again during the 15th week of the course.</p>

			<p>Prior to data analysis a coding scheme was developed. The coding scheme was based on a thematic structure derived from a priori categories identified in the literature and inductively generated categories that emerged during readings of the data. A previous pilot study was used to generate the initial categorical themes for the coding scheme. A literature review of (a) activity theory, (b) creativity, and (c) design/design thinking was used to generate the remainder of the categories.</p> 
			<p>The coding process resulted in 38 codes representing specific actions, affects, and analytical constructs. Thirteen codes were derived from identified themes within the activity theory literature. Fourteen codes were derived from identified themes within the design/design thinking literature. Nine codes were derived from identified themes within the creativity literature. Two codes were derived inductively from the texts.</p> 
			<p>All codes were categorized as either (a) action (b) affect, or (c) analytical construct. Actions were defined as goal-oriented behaviors carried out in service of the larger objective of the activity system. For example, prototyping was an action carried out in order to realize the object of the activity system, which was to design and deliver a final project. An example of affect was optimism, which may have been conditional to a related action, such as feedback seeking. Analytical constructs were mainly umbrella terms used to organize various codes for subsequent analysis. For example, contradictions was an analytical construct derived from activity theory and used to contain data characterized by significantly challenging moments or phases of project work. Figure 2 below shows the codes and their frequencies in the data.</p>
			<figure class="figure">
				<img src="images/codingScheme.png" class="img-fluid" alt="codes and their frequencies in the data set">
				<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><em>Figure 2. </em>Codes and their frequencies in the data.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>All individual references to codes were counted and rank ordered for the student design journals and the student interviews. Additionally, all references to codes were counted and rank ordered for each of the four sets of design journal entries. The four sets of journal entries were analyzed as a longitudinal time series in order to get a firmer understanding of how students’ creative design ability developed across the length of the course. Rankings of all codes are shown in Figure 3.</p>

				<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><em>Figure 3. </em>Ranking of codes by frequency.</figcaption>
			</figure>	
			<p>To add depth to the analysis, the most frequently referenced codes and the analytical construct codes were analyzed to see with which other codes they most prominently intersected. Intersecting themes were used to guide further analysis into the dynamics of the activity system. Figure 4 shows rankings for all codes within the three most frequently referenced analytical constructs. Findings from the interview data served to amplify and emphasize findings from the student journal data.</p>

			</figure>	
			<p>Data analysis and interpretation were guided by the analytical framework of activity theory (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002), thematic analysis  (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Mann, 2016), and descriptive statistics (Spatz, 2008). Findings were organized and reported using activity theory (Engeström, 2014) and narrative cognition (Bruner, 1991; Kaufman, 2002; Polkinghorne, 1995).</p>
			<h3>Findings</h3>
				<p>Across the student journal and student interview data, the analytical construct of contradictions was the most frequently referenced code. The most frequently referenced codes that intersected with the analytical construct of contradictions were tool exploration, prototyping, and community. Further reading of the data showed that many of the contradictions (i.e. challenges) that students experienced in their course work were instantiated by learning to use new design tools and building prototypes of design ideas. Throughout the student group, community was referenced as a major factor for resolving challenges and moving creative design work forward.</p>
				<p>After contradictions, the second, third, and fourth most referenced codes were tool exploration, community, and prototyping. Tool use was the earliest and leading action for students’ project work. Again, community appeared to support students’ tool learning, as they reached out to online communities and received feedback for tool learning from classroom peers and the instructor. Once students’ gained some proficiency with design tools, prototyping became the core action in the course, which was made possible by the course community. Prototyping and community had a reciprocal relationship and simultaneously supported each other’s growth and development.</p>
				<p>While prototyping typically led to challenges for students, it also served to resolve those challenges. The action of prototyping appeared to expand the course community, which by mid-way into the course became the most predominant and interconnected theme. Community appeared to be a major hub of student activity and to facilitate much of student development in terms of design ability and the most highly referenced learning outcome, creative confidence. The most frequently referenced code in the interview data was community and underscored the importance of community for the development of creative design ability.</p>
				<p>Creative confidence and emerging-new activity system were the codes that most frequently intersected with the outcome analytical construct. The most frequently coded outcomes were for new creative abilities and design methodologies. Most references to creative confidence linked with the code for psychological comfort, which was derived from the creativity literature. In this context psychological comfort indicated the course environment was conducive to and facilitated creative behaviors. Students not only reported feelings of creative confidence in themselves, but explicitly wrote and spoke about the creativity of their peers, and how valuable it was to share ideas as a method for iterating and improving their designs. Alongside newfound creative confidence, students appeared to be developing more sophisticated, human-centered design methodologies—new and emerging activity systems for accomplishing the activity of creative design.</p>
				<p>Motivation and tolerance of ambiguity were also prominently linked to student outcomes. It appeared that the high levels of student autonomy in project work afforded students the option to choose project topics that were personally meaningful. Many students reported great challenges with the need to have their own ideas for projects and indicated this kind of freedom was unusual in their experience with school. Likewise, students were given autonomy in tool choice, and this freedom appeared to instantiate authentic learning that was customized to each student’s interest. In turn, student voices evidenced persistence through difficult work and feelings of pride in their accomplishments by the end of the 15 weeks. Motivation was linked to increased ability to manage the uncertainty (Cash & Kreye, 2018) inherent to the creative design process, otherwise known as tolerance of ambiguity.</p>
			<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<p>An analysis of the findings led to an interpretation that the combination of psychological safety and shared activities greatly contributed to the establishment and growth of the course community, which the data suggest was highly influential in shaping students’ creative design ability. Therefore, a model is proposed that emphasizes behaviors that research strongly suggests supports creative behavior. These attitudes and dispositions are used to support a variety of design activities that include peer sharing of ideas, prototyping, creativity exercises, and the modeling of design conversations. It is expected that explicitly valuing student ideas by granting them the autonomy to choose their projects and tools supports motivation structures that sustain project work and support authentic and meaningful learning experiences. Figure 5 suggests guidelines for implementation of the model.</p>

					<figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"><em>Figure 5. </em>Proposed model/guidelines for supporting the growth of communites to support design creativity.</figcaption>
				</figure>	
			<p>Based on the data from the current study, it is predicted that course communities will strengthen and expand when students are given the time and autonomy to choose personally meaningful projects and are provided a structure that facilitates prototyping actions (Rauth, Köppen, Jobst, & Meinel, 2010) among peers while promoting a prototyping culture characterized by psychological safety (Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, & Herron, 1996; Cramond, 2005; Witt & Beorkrem, 1989.) It would be interesting to explore this prediction further with future research and formative interventions (Sannino, Engeström, & Lemos, 2016.)</p>
				<p>This study blended the creativity and design literature with the analytical framework of activity theory to gain firmer understanding of how creative design ability develops for novice designers in a higher education setting. The code book that was generated for this study is intended to be reusable resource for the analysis of similar learning contexts. These ideas are proposed to scholars and other stakeholders with interest in providing students with creative and social skills that are predicted to be resistant to computerization (Frey & Osborne, 2017) and therefore likely to serve students well into the future.</p>

<p><em>CHEP, Virginia Tech, 2020</em></p>
			<p>A mixed methods research design was used to explore how the creative design ability of undergraduate student designers developed over the course of a 15-week semester. Surveys, design journal entries, and interviews were used to gather data from the 25 student participants as they identified, designed, and delivered the individual projects that focused their work in the course. Several contextual factors characterized the development of students’ design creativity, and the most prominent were (a) tool exploration, (b) prototyping, (d) community, (d) motivation, and (e) creative agency. Research methodology, findings, and recommendations for future course design and research will be presented.</p>
			
			<p>A mixed methods research design was used to explore how the creative design ability of undergraduate student designers was shaped over the course of a 15-week semester. An extensive review of the creativity and design literature generated a coding scheme that was integrated into an activity system analysis (Engeström, 2014; Jonassen, 2002) of the project-based learning course in this study. Surveys, design journal entries, and interviews gathered data from the 25 student participants as they conducted course work. A pre/post survey (Blizzard et al., 2015) was used to measure changes in participants’ design thinking traits during the semester.</p>
			<p>This research identified five prominent contextual factors that characterized the development of students’ design creativity, which were the following: (a) tool exploration, (b) prototyping, (d) community, (d) motivation, and (e) creative agency. These factors were reciprocal with each other as they expanded, and a sequential timing was found in the establishment of participant motivation and the growth of the course community.</p>
			<p>Journal and interview data suggested granting participants a high degree of autonomy in their course work facilitated their motivation and engagement. Without strong motivation, it is doubtful participants would have engaged the varied design ambiguities of project work as extensively and persistently as they did. It appeared that establishing motivation early in the course was a key to the other gains they experienced as a result of their sustained efforts.</p>
			<p>Once participants settled on project topics, the remaining four factors emerged as a cluster of actions and affect. Tool exploration involved participants identifying design tools and making choices about which ones to use and how to use them. This action was closely bound with prototyping action, in which participants made their abstract design ideas concrete to share them with peers and the course instructor. The presenting and sharing actions involved with tool exploration and prototyping were regular in-class occurrences and facilitated growth of the course community, which emerged as one of the most influential factors that shaped participants’ design creativity. The course community emerged as a design tool that participants used to iterate and improve their design ideas. In this way, participants’ design methodologies expanded from individual to collective orientations as a result of their course experience.</p>
			<p>Creative agency (Karwowski & Beghetto, 2018; Royalty, Oishi, & Roth, 2014) was the affective outcome participants reported most frequently and was also linked with the most prominent actions (i.e., tool exploration, prototyping, and community interactions) found in course activity. Several participants explained that in addition to feeling more creative as individuals, they appreciated creativity in others because they used peer and instructor feedback to improve their own design ideas. In this way, participants’ development of creative agency expanded from individual to collective orientations. A set of practical guidelines for project-based instruction and suggestions for the most productive future research will be also be presented.</p>

<h2 class="card-title">Designing creatively: Classroom activities for project-based learning</h2>
<p><em>CHEP, Virginia Tech, 2020</em></p>
	
<p>What classroom activities can be used to support a group of students who are all working on individual projects across multiple domains? This is the question the presenters faced as they designed and led project-based courses to help undergraduate students learn to use technology more innovatively in the workplace. Methods from design thinking provided many of classroom activities, and lessons from the creativity literature helped to inform the way the activities were implemented and modeled by the instructors. This session will provide an overview of the course design and the classroom activities that engaged students and the instructors.</p>
<p>The course was project-based (Blumenfeld et al., 1991; Condliffe, 2017; Edutopia, 2001) and its design was informed by the theoretical perspectives of constructionism, situated cognition/situated learning, and self-directed learning—as described by Clinton and Rieber (2010) and especially with regard to the freedom in choosing any project topic, which was a primary characteristic of the first of three sequential courses in the studio experience. The assignments and in-class activities completed by students were based upon theories and practices borrowed from the creativity and design thinking literature. While students did most their project work outside of class, classroom activities were oriented toward helping students to share ideas and to provide each other with design feedback.</p>
<p>A unifying theme that might be applied to all class activity is community building. Eventually, the course community became characterized by a  “culture of prototyping” (Rauth, Köppen, Jobst, & Meinel, 2010, p. 3), but building the community took time. In this session we will share the classroom activities that helped to build the supportive course community. These activities are (a) tool presentations, (b) idea presentations, and (c) prototype presentations that incorporated peer review and feedback. Attendees will be asked to participate by briefly sharing some favorite tools they use to accomplish their work as a way of modeling the way idea sharing activities were implemented in our course.</p>
<p>Creativity research has produced some basic findings about the nature of creativity, such as its generally accepted definition (Runco & Jaeger, 2012), divergent thinking (Silvia et al., 2008), convergent thinking (Cropley, 2006), problem finding (Getzels, 1975), and psychological safety (Amabile & Pillemer, 2012). The instructors simplified and shared findings from this and similar research as a way of demystifying creativity for students, and to help them understand that creativity is a skill that can be developed as any other. Attendees will be asked to complete a brief survey assessing their beliefs about their creativity and the results will then be displayed and briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Finally, the general course design will be described, and the presenters will provide their assessment of the effectiveness of the course, including ideas for improvement. At this point the attendees will be asked to engage in a design conversation concerning any questions or ideas they may have about implementing a similar kind of learning environment.</p>
